# Dictionary Spell Checker (C++)
This project is a C++ application that performs fast word lookup, spell checking, and word suggestion using an efficient prefix-based data structure. It is designed to load a large collection of English words and allow users to quickly verify spelling and receive helpful suggestions when a word is not found.

The program demonstrates how core data structures can be applied to real-world text processing problems such as spell checking, autocomplete, and dictionary search.

# Overview
The application loads a dictionary dataset and organizes it in memory to allow:
  * Fast word searches
  * Prefix-based suggestions
  * Alphabetical traversal of words
  * Efficient handling of large word lists
This project focuses on performance, organization of data, and practical use of data structures in a realistic setting.

# Features
  * Load a dictionary file into memory
  * Check if a word exists (spell check)
  * Suggest similar words when a word is not found
  * Display words in alphabetical order
  * Efficient prefix searching for autocomplete-style behavior

# Concepts Demonstrated
  * This project provides hands-on experience with:
  * Tree-based data structures for fast lookup
  * Recursive traversal and node management
  * File reading and data parsing
  * Designing search and suggestion algorithms
  * Organizing large datasets efficiently in memory
  * Building a practical text-processing tool in C++

# Applications
The techniques used in this project are similar to those used in:

  * Search engines
  * Phone keyboard word prediction
  * Text editors and word processors
  * Autocomplete systems
  * Dictionary and reference tools

# Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how an efficient data structure can be used to build a practical spell checker and word lookup system capable of handling large dictionaries with high performance.
